## About <a name = "about"></a>

The Solidity Guide repository covers basic ERC standards and smart contracts. It is designed to help users who are new to smart contracts easily test and study them. Each smart contract code includes test codes to make it easier to understand and test.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

In each folder, you will find a README that contains a description of the contract and instructions on how to execute it.

Smart Contract에 대한 테스트를 진행하고, Contract에 대한 내용을 정리하여 올려주세요. 이를 위해 먼저 Issue를 생성하여 어떤 Contract을 올릴 것인지 명시해 주세요. Hardhat, Forge 등 어떤 프레임워크를 사용해도 괜찮지만, 해당 Contract을 실행하는 방법에 대한 내용을 정리해 주시면 좋겠습니다.
Please test the smart contract and compile the details about the contract. To do this, first create an issue specifying which contract you will be uploading. You can use any framework, such as Hardhat or Forge, but please include instructions on how to run the contract.
