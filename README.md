## About <a name = "about"></a>

The Solidity Guide repository covers basic ERC standards and smart contracts. It is designed to help users who are new to smart contracts easily test and study them. Each smart contract code includes test codes to make it easier to understand and test.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

In each folder, you will find a README that contains a description of the contract and instructions on how to execute it.

## Contribution <a name = "contribution"></a>

Please test the smart contract and compile the details about the contract. To do this, first create an issue specifying which contract you will be uploading. You can use any framework, such as Hardhat or Forge, but please include instructions on how to run the contract.
